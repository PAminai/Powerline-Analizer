# Powerline Analizer

This program can analyze powerline based on following modes:

1. Single Circuit and No Bundle
2. Single Circuit and Bundle
3. Two Circuit and No Bundle
4. Two Circuit and Bundle

The output of this analysis are **Voltage Regulation** and **Efficiency** of power system.

**Note:**
You only need to run **Main_File.m** and no need to open **PSA.m**. Because PSA.m is a function called in the Main_File.m.

Any feedback is warmly appreciated.
